            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>I am a responsible person with strong time-management skills and a high capacity for learning. I appreciate professionalism and honesty in people.</p>
            <p>I have no experience in web front-end development but am eager to gain some. I want to develop myself and learn new things, as I currently lack new challenges and tasks.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, I have no completed projects yet. At the moment, I am working on a CV project.</p>
            <p>My hobbies include reading, running, and coin collecting.</p>
